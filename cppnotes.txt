 //c++-->inititally called as c with classes by stroustroup
    //classes-->extension of structures ie ***structure+more
    //structures had limitations
    //            -->members are public
    //            -->no methods ie we can't add functions inside the structure
    //classes can have methods(functions) and properties(values)
    //classes can make few members as private &few as public
    //in c++ structures names can be shortened without typedef
    //you can declare objects along with the class declaration
        // class employee{
        //     //class defination
        // }harry,rohan,lovesh;***************************valid syntax
    //harry.slary=8 makes no sence if salary is private

constructor is a special member function with the same name as of the class
and is used to initialze the objects of the class
